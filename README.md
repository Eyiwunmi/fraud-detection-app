# Real-Time Credit Card Fraud Detection System (XGBoost + Streamlit)

This project focuses on building a **real-time credit card fraud detection system** using XGBoost and Streamlit, designed to identify and classify fraudulent transactions 
with high accuracy and transparency.

### 🧠 Model Capabilities

The model classifies transactions into three categories:
🚨 **FRAUD** – highly likely fraudulent transactions
🕵️ **REVIEW** – suspicious transactions requiring human supervision
✅ **CLEAR** – legitimate transactions.

### 🎯 Project Overview
The goal of this work is to demonstrate how **machine learning** can be applied to detect fraudulent behavior in financial transactions efficiently. 
The model was trained on an **imbalanced dataset of credit card transactions**  and uses a **threshold-based classification system** to manage prediction confidence.

Although this version focuses on **credit card fraud**, the system can be **modified to detect mobile or bank transfer fraud** depending on organizational use cases.  
It can also be **integrated into a fintech API or transaction database** for real-time automatic prediction.

### 🧩 Tech Stack
- 🐍 **Python 3.10+**  
- ⚙️ **XGBoost**  
- 🌐 **Streamlit** (for real-time dashboard)  
- 📊 **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Scikit-learn**  
- 📈 **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**  
- 💾 **Joblib** (for model serialization)
